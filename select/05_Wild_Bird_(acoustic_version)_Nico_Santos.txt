You've been talkin' in my sleep
You keep walkin' like you'll leave
We were nothin' but fire
And now you're nothin' but tired
Used to look down from above
But right now, you're down on us
I keep pullin' you closer
But we are gettin' no closer
And it hurts, someone like me

'Cause your heart is like a wild bird
And you don't know how to fly it, girl
Changes too much on the breeze
Just to love someone like me
Yeah, your heart is like a wild bird

When I want you flyin' with me
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm
Mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm (yeah, eh)
When I want you flyin' with me
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm
Mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm
Yeah, your heart is like a wild bird
When I want you flyin' with me

See you hurtin' in those eyes
They keep burnin' straight through mine
Baby, nobody's perfect
But I thought that we were workin'
So I've watched us for a while
And I've waited for the smiles
But they keep disappearin'
Girl, I hope that you can hear me
So now, now it's my turn

To say your heart is like a wild bird
And it flew you way too high, girl
Waitin' for you on the ground
I thought I could talk you down
But your heart is like a wild bird

When I want you flyin' with me
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm
Mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm (yeah, eh)
When I want you flyin' with me
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm
Mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm
Yeah, your heart is like a wild bird

12 days, no change
Heartbreaks, I keep feelin'
Some say you won't stay
So now it's my turn to say, to say

Yeah, your heart is like a wild bird
And you don't know how to fly it, girl
Changes too much on the breeze
Just to love someone like me
Yeah, your heart is like a wild bird

Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm (yeah, eh)
Mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm (yeah, eh)
When I want you flyin' with me
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm (yeah, eh)
Mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm
Yeah, your heart is like a wild bird
When I want you flyin' with me
