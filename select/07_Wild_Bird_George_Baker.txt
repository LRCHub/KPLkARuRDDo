Let me sing a song for you
And let me be your star
Every time I look into your eyes
I'm really far
Never knowing what to say
Or knowing what to do
All the good things in my life
Are just the thought of you

You are just a wild bird
Playing in the silver sky
I'm a tree that waits for you
To let you rest a while
You can hide here if you want
For winter, storm and snow
In the shelter of my arms
You let your feeling show

So sweet little wild bird
Won't you sing this song with me
Together we shall sing
In perfect tune and harmony
But if you stay alone
Yes in the winter you must die
Yes, I will teach me how to walk
You'll teach me how to fly - fly

So sweet little wild bird
Won't you sing this song with me
Together we shall sing
In perfect tune and harmony
But if you stay alone
Yes in the winter you must die
Yes, I will teach me how to walk
You'll teach me how to fly - fly
