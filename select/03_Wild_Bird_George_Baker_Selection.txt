Let me sing, a song for you
And let me be your star
Every time I look into your eyes
I'm really fine
Never knowing what to say
Or knowing what to do
All the goods things in my life
Are just a part of you

You are just a wild bird playing
In the silver sky
I'm a tree that waits for you
To let you rest a while
You can hide here if you want
From winter storm and snow
In the shelter of my arms
You let your feelings show

So sweet little wild bird
Won't you sing this song with me
Together we shall sing
In perfect tune and harmony
And if you stay here long
Yes in the winter you must die
As I will teach you how to walk
You teach me how to fly, fly.

(Repeat Last Verse)
